# NAU Stuff
A bunch of various scripts that I needed to get things working at NAU.

# SC-Autoconnect
SC-Autoconnect.py is a python script that assists headless SafeConnect users connect to the network. It's very useful if you are on a low-memory platform such as a Raspberry Pi and want to run updates. To get the script to work, just change the text saying USERNAME and PASSWORD to your username and password.
